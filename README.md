# Pulse
<b>SBHacks VII Project</b>

## Motivation
The current pandemic and the difficulties faced in online classrooms inspired us to make this project!

## Description
Pulse allows professors to quickly understand their students' reactions and understanding in real-time with polls and a unique "pulse" feature which allows students to share their feelings on the leture. The platform is now used by several professors and student organizations for remote lectures and meetings.

## Technologies
We built this using React.js, Next.js, and MongoDB. The repository is hooked up to Heroku for live demos.
